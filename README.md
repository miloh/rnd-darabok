============
pcb pieces created with pcb-rnd 


1. egy (one) - this pcb-rnd lihata layout is for testing a layout engine as well as fabrication capabilities, it tests the following:
 * reproduce plated holes from 0.1mm to 1mm in 0.1mm increments
 * reproduce silk markings and exposed Ag-Au-Sn marking in sizes from A to B in 10% size incrmeents
 * reproduce Cu traces from A to B in X increments
 * reproduce traces on silk, sub-mask, and sub-Cu layers from A to B in X increment 
 * reproduction of sizes from .1mm to 1mm
 * gradients
   - gradient from silk layer & mask layer
   - gradient from Au-Ag-Sn to Mask
   - gradient from Au-Ag-Sn to Sub-mask
 * checkerboards in M by N rectangle with X by Y squares
    - checkerboard sample area in sub-mask & mask area 
    - checkerboard sample area in conductive & mask re
    - checkerboard sample area in sub-mask and conductive area 

2. kettő (two)
 * octagonal pendant 
   - tests editmask and hole capabilities

3. három
 * pcb-rnd reference french curve, alternative to pcb-ruler craze
 * tests internal routing capbilities, includes pop-out 0.1" pitch to smd adapter boards

4. négy
 * pcb-rnd golden icosahedron
  - tests slot, egy checkerboards, and repeatability, & also a pretty project

5. öt
 * pcb-rnd reference angle
  - alterntive to the pcb ruler craze, more area for refernce material
